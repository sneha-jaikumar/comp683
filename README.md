Repository for COMP 683 (Computational Biology) Final Project

## Datasets
1. Fetal microglia data from [Kracht et al. 2020](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba5906) - This dataset includes data on fetal microglia spanning gestational weeks 9 to 18, analyzed and presented in the study. [Download dataset](https://github.com/sneha-jaikumar/comp683/blob/main/adata_merge_fetuses_leiden.h5ad). The metadata can be found [here](https://github.com/sneha-jaikumar/comp683/blob/main/fetuses_metadata.xlsx).
   
2. Fetal microglia data from [Thion et al. 2018](https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.lib.unc.edu/science/article/pii/S0092867417314320?via%3Dihub#mmc7) - This dataset includes bulk RNA sequencing data on fetal microglia spanning gestational weeks 14 to 24 weeks. The data has already been normalized and ILMN IDs have been converted to Gene Symbols. The data was downloaded from [here](https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.libproxy.lib.unc.edu/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE107128).
